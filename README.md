# Demo Task

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game created using HTML and CSS.

## Setup

To run this project, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in a web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/demo-task.git
```

## Usage

Once the game is loaded in the web browser, players can take turns clicking on the squares to place their X or O. The first player to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

## Code Explanation

The game logic is implemented using JavaScript. The game board is represented as an array with 9 elements, each representing a square on the board. The game checks for a win by checking all possible winning combinations after each move.
