# Demo Task

This is a simple tic tac toe game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a 3x3 grid with dynamic colors and fully functional gameplay.

## Setup

To run this game locally, simply download the project files and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

Once the game is loaded, players can take turns clicking on the grid to place their X or O symbol. The game will automatically switch turns and display a message if a player wins or if the game ends in a tie.

## Code Explanation

The `index.html` file contains the structure of the game grid and the necessary styling is done in the `styles.css` file. The functionality of the game is implemented in the `script.js` file, where logic for checking win conditions, switching turns, and handling player input is coded.
